# Skolem's Paradox

Topics needed to be covered:
- classical logic: models and domains
- cardinality: countable vs uncountable

[in-depth article](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-skolem/)

**LÃ¶wenheim-Skolem theorem**: If a first-order theory (countable collection of first-order sentences) has infinite models, then it has models whose domain are only countable

**Cantor's theorem**: There exist uncountable sets

**Skolem's paradox**: Cantorian set theory - the principles used to prove the existence of uncountable sets - can be formulated as a collection of first-order sentences. How can the very principles which prove the existence of uncountable sets be satisfied by a model which is itself only countable?

Philosophical discussions tend to focus on three main questions:
1. Why doesn't Skolem's paradox introduce an outright contradiction into set theory?
2. Why did Skolem and his contemporaries continue to find the paradox so philosophically troubling?
3. What does the paradox tell us about our understanding of set theory and/or the semantics of set-theoretic language?
